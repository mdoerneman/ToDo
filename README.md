#ToDo

## Focus on one task at a time

For each of your projects on [Todoist](http://www.todoist.com), ToDo will pick 1 task at random when you click "get some" and mark the due date 'today'. This will allow you to focus on one task at a time. When you complete the task, click 'done' to mark it as complete.

Tasks with a priority set will be chosen first.

Re-curring tasks will always show until completed.
